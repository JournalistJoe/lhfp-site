## About Page

### Page Hero
**Headline**: "The Long Haired Freaky People Need Not Apply"

**Introduction**:
"That's what the sign said. So we tucked our hair under our hats, learned the game, then built our own playground.

LHFP Consulting exists because the best solutions rarely come from people who follow all the rules."

### Origin Story Section
**Headline**: "From Food & Beverage to Full-Stack"

**Body Copy**:
"LHFP started as a holding company for our food and beverage digital agency, SKUStory. But we kept meeting fascinating founders outside the F&B world ‚Äî mission-driven people solving interesting problems who needed technical help without the corporate consulting experience.

The name? It's from the Five Man Electrical Band song 'Signs.' A anthem about arbitrary barriers and the people brave enough to challenge them. That's our clients. That's us.

We're based in West Kelowna, BC, where the fishing is good and the wifi is strong."

### Philosophy Deep Dive
**Headline**: "Why Fly Fishing?"

**Body Copy**:
"Ask any fly fisherman worth their salt, and they'll tell you: success isn't about expensive gear or secret spots. It's about observation. Patience. Understanding.

You watch the water. Note the insects. See what the fish are actually eating. Then you match the hatch ‚Äî choosing the right fly for this specific moment in this specific stream.

Digital strategy works the same way. We can't just show up with the same solutions everyone else is peddling. We need to observe your market, understand your customers, see what's actually working. Only then can we tie the perfect solution.

It's harder than throwing buzzwords at the wall. But it works."

### Values Section
**Headline**: "What We Stand For"

**Values List**:
1. **Observation Over Assumption**
   "We watch before we act. Every business has its own stream."

2. **Craft Over Convenience**
   "We'd rather tie the perfect fly than grab something off the shelf."

3. **Partners, Not Vendors**
   "We work with people we'd want to grab a beer (or go fishing) with."

4. **Clear Over Clever**
   "Good code is readable. Good strategy is understandable."

5. **Mission Over Metrics**
   "Revenue matters. Purpose matters more."

### Founder Bio
**Headline**: "About Your Guide"

**Body Copy**:
"Joey Brennan has been helping businesses navigate digital waters since 2014. What started with sweetening up a sterile commodity brand evolved into a passion for helping mission-driven founders build something real online.

When not debugging code or optimizing email flows, you'll find them actually fly fishing the streams around West Kelowna, still observing, still learning, still matching the hatch.

Previous catches include [2-3 brief client successes]. Current obsessions include [2-3 current tech/business interests]."

## Philosophy Page

### Hero
**Headline**: "Match the Hatch: A Philosophy"
**Subhead**: "Why we approach digital strategy like fly fishing"

### Opening Manifesto
"In fly fishing, there's a principle: match the hatch. You don't show up with whatever fly you feel like using. You observe what insects are hatching, what the fish are eating right now, in this specific water, on this specific day. Then you tie your fly to match.

Most consultants show up with a tackle box full of the same lures everyone else is using. Best practices. Industry standards. Template solutions.

We show up with eyes open and tools ready to build exactly what's needed."

### The Observation Phase
**Headline**: "First, We Watch the Water"

"Every stream tells a story:
- How fast is the current? (Your market dynamics)
- What's hatching today? (Customer needs right now)
- Where are the fish holding? (Where your customers gather)
- What spooked them yesterday? (Failed approaches)

We spend time understanding your specific ecosystem before we ever make a cast."

### The Adaptation Phase
**Headline**: "Then, We Tie the Right Fly"

"Once we understand your stream:
- We craft solutions specific to your situation
- We use tools that match your technical comfort
- We build at the pace your business can sustain
- We adjust when conditions change

No preset packages. No one-size-fits-all strategies. Just the right solution for right now."

### The Patience Principle
**Headline**: "Good Things Take Time"

"Fly fishing isn't about throwing as many casts as possible. It's about making the right cast at the right time.

Digital strategy works the same way:
- Better to launch one thing well than ten things poorly
- Quality data beats quantity every time
- Sustainable growth outlasts growth hacks
- The right customers are worth waiting for"

### Who This Works For
**Headline**: "Our Kind of People"

"This approach isn't for everyone. It's for:
- Founders who think long-term
- Businesses with a real mission
- People who value craft over speed
- Leaders willing to try something different

If you're looking for quick fixes and growth hacks, we're not your people. If you're building something meaningful and want a partner who gets it, let's talk."
