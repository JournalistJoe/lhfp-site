## Voice & Tone

### Writing Principles
1. **Clear over Clever** - Like clean code, our copy should be immediately understandable
2. **Show, Don't Sell** - Demonstrate understanding through examples
3. **Technical but Human** - We can discuss APIs and talk about fishing in the same breath
4. **Quietly Confident** - No need to shout when you know your craft

### Voice Characteristics
- Thoughtful and observant
- Technically competent without jargon
- Warmly professional
- Subtly countercultural

### Example Copy Comparisons

❌ **Don't Write**: "Leveraging cutting-edge AI solutions to transform your digital ecosystem"

✅ **Do Write**: "We watch how your customers move through your digital streams, then build the right tools to catch them"

❌ **Don't Write**: "Industry-leading expertise in automation and integration"

✅ **Do Write**: "We've spent years learning which flies work in which water. Now we tie custom solutions for your specific stream"

## Dark Mode Considerations
- Always design dark mode first
- Ensure sufficient contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- Adjust colors for reduced eye strain
- Toggle should be obvious but not obtrusive
- Remember: many developers prefer dark mode

## Accessibility
- All colors meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
- Focus states clearly visible
- Alt text for all images
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation fully supported
