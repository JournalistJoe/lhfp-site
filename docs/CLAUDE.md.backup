# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

LHFP (Long Haired Freaky People) Consulting Services website - a Next.js-based website for a digital consulting agency that specializes in custom solutions for mission-driven businesses.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **CMS**: Sanity v3
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Analytics**: Plausible or Fathom

## Common Commands

Since this project is not yet initialized, here are the commands you'll need after setup:

```bash
# Initialize Next.js project
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run production build locally
npm run start

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Project Structure
```
/app              # Next.js App Router pages
/components       # Reusable React components
/lib              # Utility functions and shared logic
/sanity           # Sanity CMS configuration
/public           # Static assets
/styles           # Global styles and Tailwind config
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Dark Mode First**: All designs should prioritize dark mode with optional light mode
2. **Water-Inspired**: Use the defined color palette (Deep Water #0A1628, Stream Blue #1E3A5F, Casting Green #059669)
3. **Typography**: Inter for headers/body, JetBrains Mono for code blocks
4. **Performance**: Target Lighthouse scores of 95+ across all metrics

### Brand Implementation

- Implement the "reading the water" philosophy throughout UX
- Use fly fishing metaphors naturally in copy
- Include developer-focused easter eggs (console messages, keyboard shortcuts)
- Maintain anti-corporate, authentic voice

### Service Pages Structure

Each service page should include:
- Clear value proposition
- Detailed process explanation
- Pricing information
- Call-to-action ("Cast a Line")

### Critical Features

1. **"Cast a Line" Interactive Element**: Primary CTA throughout site
2. **Smart Content Loading**: Progressive enhancement based on user behavior
3. **Case Studies**: Follow Problem → Observation → Solution → Results format
4. **Contact Form**: Conversational with qualification questions

## Development Notes

- Mobile-first responsive design is mandatory
- No stock photography - use abstract patterns or code-inspired visuals
- Implement smooth scroll and subtle animations with Framer Motion
- Ensure all interactive elements have proper keyboard navigation
- Keep accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) in mind
